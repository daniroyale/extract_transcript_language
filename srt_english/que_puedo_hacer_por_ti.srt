1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,480
Good truth, to understand what God does in our lives and be able to

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:20,359
Understand many things in our hearts, right?Many times we believe that

3
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,160
We are fine, this time we have been talking about many situations, capable that has to do with

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,039
People and capable are calm, capable we believe we are doing things well, but

5
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,200
Many times we forget that God always has a purpose, right?And even though

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,520
There may be a need or not, many times God always sees the intention of

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,439
our hearts and he is always there to see what what we have to do

8
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:59,359
And sometimes we are calm, right?We are very apparently, but God wants something else

9
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:05,640
From us, God wants something different, we will share something that many times capable

10
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,480
We have heard it, many times we have shared, capable have heard this word, but it has to

11
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,719
See with the intention of our hearts and how God also sees those intentions.I first

12
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:27,840
I'm going to talk to you something descriptive, let's imagine or imagine that we were at that time

13
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,959
Where is the Lord Jesus, we could not terra

14
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:38,680
Things and we can leave the biblical text.And that we have an interview of a person who had

15
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,760
had an encounter with the Lord, that God had done something in his life and the story a little

16
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,840
Testimony of how it rose is transformed.And what happens?A character is known, it is a

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,040
Bible character, which we have often heard.Bartimaeo called me, the son of

18
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:03,519
Timéo, but scam and my mother generated blind, I had never seen the light, I didn't know what a

19
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:10,719
Color, he never met a face, he didn't know what a smile was.My world was a poor world,

20
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:18,159
Not only because I didn't have his eyes, but either after wealth, a family that

21
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:25,960
Soon he said to me because my own still accused them, a city that expelled me because my

22
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:32,159
presence was the mark of weakness, this was my life, next to the road, in the Anteua,

23
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:39,680
The old rap jericop, that of the walls lying down, the rebuilt, at the price of blood, blessed and

24
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:47,479
Damn Jericop.Damn for me, from my crib, although my crib gave me, to think that the blind man was

25
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:53,639
I, but there were many who accused me, who mistreated me, that marginalized me, that discarded me,

26
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:02,639
It was they who saw the human being that I am, did not know about my dreams, without images,

27
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:11,319
of my desire, without answers, colds of the world, and I although blind, I saw, I saw the pride of

28
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:17,560
The mediacrés, the legalism that it expels, the painful disease of those who believe they are healthy because

29
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:26,199
Come, do not see their own pocado, which is the worst illness, blind and poor, but not so blind and poor

30
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:34,000
Like some rich vidan, blind does not mean deaf, and listened to the passerships of the thousand

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,759
caravans that passed from the length, enriched my poor world with the sounds and voices with the

32
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:45,479
Amedias stories that came to me with the comments when I passed, and History Companies began to

33
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:53,520
I answer again and again, one man, one Jesus, and listened to many things about the things there were

34
00:03:53,520 --> 00:04:01,280
Fact, some said, the Hitico had walked in Jerusalem, near Siloé's tobill,

35
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:10,120
that the demons were at their voice and their presence, a girl had been resurrected and cited,

36
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:19,600
I arrive, you listened to those stories and as I wanted to believe them, I wanted to know that it was true and that if

37
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,040
He was close to mine could have an opportunity, occasionally when some with a little more

38
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:32,480
Desimpatía stopped close to me took to ask and so I learned that it was believed that

39
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,680
He was a descendant of King David, who had been baptized by Juan and that at that time he had

40
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:45,240
manifested the abo of God, the rumors announced that he was a prophet of the ancients, in the style of

41
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,720
Managers, or at the same day he turned to Earth, once a follower of John, the

42
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,800
baptizer prophet that had been killed by Hereores, he did treated me well, even me

43
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:04,360
He gave the layer he had, because he said that this was what John taught and that Jesus was the one who

44
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:11,120
Juan had announced, told me that Juan when he was in jail had sent him and others from

45
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,120
His followers, to meet Jesus to ask whether he was the bedside table or had to wait

46
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,560
To others, those things that I listened to, that I moved in the comments of the travelers and

47
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:30,040
That they were my own mushroom, the deepest of my claims, the most dream of my dreams, thus

48
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,759
That was the true told me and if it were true I came to the conclusion, it will be the Messiah and if

49
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:43,279
It is the Messiah will sooner or later come to Jerusalem and will have to go through Jericho and I will have the

50
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:50,720
opportunity to ask you like others to look at me and effectively the day arrived, I heard

51
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,399
The rumors, I prepared my soul, was the opportunity of my life and I was not going to lose, so when I knew

52
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:03,879
That I was close, I began to call it, to call it from what I wanted to believe, Jesus, son of David,

53
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:10,519
It wasn't the towal that wanted to shut me up, but how I was silent I had to sound my voice more

54
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:15,639
that again, if something true there were in Jesus in what I had heard of him, I had to hear me,

55
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:23,160
I had to hear, that I was blind, the poor, the hurt, the marginalized, that nobody understood, it was

56
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:31,920
That, the Jesus I imagined and my blind imagination, and me or me, and made me approach,

57
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:39,000
It is altered like a spring, there flew the layer that the disciple Juan guided by

58
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,720
The voices ran their encounter in the last act of my seguera and then a question arose

59
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:54,879
Unusual, a question that touched my heart over and over again, I can put the disciple of

60
00:06:54,879 --> 00:07:04,560
The message, and I try to contextualize a question, we could say that I can do for

61
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:12,240
You, but Lord Jesus told this blind Bartimaeus, what do you want me to do for you?

62
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:21,120
What are you Sante?We are going to say to the book of Lucas, Lucas, and we will be able, more or less see, the

63
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,759
text, right?To be able to contextualize a little to what happened and how it was.

64
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:37,720
Lord Jesus with Bartimaeus, Luke, Chapter 18, verse 35, did he answer that Jesus approaching us

65
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:44,560
Jericho?A blind man was sitting next to the road begging, and to go to the crowd that passed,

66
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:52,959
He asked that it was that, and they told him that Jesus, Nazarene, then voices saying,

67
00:07:52,959 --> 00:08:00,199
Jesus, son of David, had mercy on me, and those who went, in front of him so that

68
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:06,720
I shut up, but he who goes to much more, son of David Ten my sericord of me, than his

69
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,120
Then stopping, he ordered him to bring him to his presence, and when he arrived he asked him,

70
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:21,680
Saying, what do you want me to do you there just?How interesting, right?That question,

71
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:28,279
What do you want me to do?What do you want me to do for you?What do you want me to do for you?

72
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:40,320
We could say it, right?That encounter that the Lord had with Bartimaeus.Now, look at a

73
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:47,679
Curious thing, right?We were contextualizing, and obviously he was there and he was a beggar,

74
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:54,320
But he was blind, right?And the question would be, why did the Lord Jesus ask him,

75
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,960
What do you want me to do for you?It was not obvious that he was blind and that what he needed capable

76
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:06,559
It was humanly to see.He will have thought about his heart, right?They will really be enesid,

77
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:12,960
Are you not realizing that I can't see and that I need this?Why is it that

78
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,200
The Lord Jesus asked him that question?What do you want me to do for you?What do you want me to do for you?TRUE?

79
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:26,000
because?Now it's very interesting, right?This question has an intention.

80
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,159
Simple, sir, go beyond what we see, beyond what we believe,

81
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:40,200
And we could seek many explanations that Jesus wanted to prove his faith.Those wanted to see

82
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:47,720
Truly what was the intention of his heart.How interesting, right?And they know, many

83
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,679
times throughout our life we are also happening some situations.Many

84
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:59,320
very difficult situations, in which we have tried to find an answer and we have not

85
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:07,679
found.We have gone to other places we have even been able to look for God too, but

86
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:13,600
We have found answers.But let's imagine that at a given time in all that time,

87
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:23,240
We have an encounter with Jesus and that we would have, I don't know physically or

88
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:29,360
Not capable, but that we listen to that voice that God tells us and what calls us, right?

89
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:38,320
And that I would ask us what you want me to do for you, what do you want me to do for you.AND

90
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,480
What happened you could arise that.This is a man who was happening many situations.We set

91
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:51,080
A little the historical context, some data that say them are valid and you look for

92
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:55,960
In the historical part, this is a contemporary narrative and many of the data are void,

93
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:02,399
Able that the form is a bit different, but this man is.This man had been

94
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:10,080
marginalized because he was a person who could not be a person who could be part of the

95
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,960
society because I had an inability and many times we listen to that, but I want us to

96
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:22,759
Let's go a little more to be able to see the intention of the question, right?And why many times

97
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:32,639
The yes, we don't see, right?And many times he wants to see our intention of the

98
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:40,360
Thing we are living.So, for you or is facing that situation, right?

99
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:48,840
And at that moment the abso so fast, I need, I obviously, I can't see, this is my need.

100
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:54,519
But, despite that, the Lord tells him, what do you want me to do to you?

101
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:05,960
It's very interesting, right?Because the Lord always see other things that we do not see

102
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:13,039
And it is also disappearing what are the intentions of our heart and truly what are the

103
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:20,240
Things that we are yearning and if those things are well or are not right, right?

104
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:28,279
What do you want me to do?We are going to the book of Mateo, Chapter 7, Mateo, Chapter 7, verse 7,

105
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:38,600
And there we have some answers.What does not say the Lord?Order and you will be given, search and find,

106
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:48,159
call and open, verse 8, why everyone who asks receives and the one who seeks and who

107
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:54,240
Call will open, right?The Lord was telling us, he was teaching that one has to ask

108
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:02,360
To the father, one has to know that we will find an answer.Here was this blind, right?

109
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:11,960
And he was seeing a need that he had practically.Then he was asking and he

110
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:18,639
I was calling.Then the Lord Jesus, at that time of the entire crowd that was happening,

111
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:25,039
He stopped, he did what he had to do, he took it into account, although there were people who

112
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:31,639
that he had discarded, he took into account this man that he was asking for something, not just that,

113
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:38,320
but sent him to call.And when he sent him to call, he was in front of him, that is, he took a

114
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:45,960
time to be with him.It is a long time something of our life, the Lord murdered sisters,

115
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:55,559
That took time to be with us.He is not heard, he takes all the

116
00:13:55,559 --> 00:14:03,720
Needs that we are happening, but they also know the intention of our heart.

117
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:13,080
See what intention is.And Bartimae will have been re -questioned again, and is not seeing

118
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:20,159
What you are still.Obviously that is what I need.As I told them, let's imagine that

119
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,320
Lord was there, right?And he asks you, or I don't know if we are happening any need,

120
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,799
I don't know if you have a need today.Such a difficult situation that many times capable, nobody

121
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:37,480
He knows, that has to do with a personal aspect, which has to do with a family aspect, that

122
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,639
It has to see capable with a loved one.It is much time to have to do with work.Much time

123
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,320
It has to do with your body, because there is something that is failing, you already feel tired,

124
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,799
Or he feels tired of always a disease, a situation with his health.Layers a

125
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:59,200
something.And at that time in all that situation, well I find the Lord Jesus.And the Lord

126
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:05,919
He tells us and tells you, tells me, what do you want me to do for you?And what is many

127
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:12,519
Sometimes we have heard, but I already asked the Lord.I have long

128
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:18,000
I have said that Lord does this in my life, that God transforms this, that he worked with my family,

129
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,480
That this situation turns at work and nothing happens and I don't see any response.

130
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:29,279
And we could have many explanations and I am going to give some, why don't it happen?Come on

131
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:37,000
To the book of Santiago, Chapter 4. Santiago, Chapter 4, Verse 2 First.Discounted

132
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:48,759
The 3. Thank you, Malico.He says, do you elbow and don't have?Matá and Ardeis de Envidia and you can't

133
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:58,840
Reach, fight and fight, but you don't have what you want because you don't ask.And here comes

134
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:04,399
The key verse, right?I am important that we ask, they have at the youth meeting

135
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,519
That we said virtual, they speak a little of this, right?Sometimes you have to hort specifically

136
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:16,320
of what we are happening.But here Santiago, which is his very particular book that does not speak

137
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,840
Characteristic of adequate Christian behavior, how do you not have to handle a Christian?God

138
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:31,240
He speaks to us through Santiago and says, you ask and do not receive, because you ask badly to spend on

139
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:40,360
Your delites.And they know, many times it has to do with that.We are selfish and many

140
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:47,200
Sometimes we ask for our needs that is wrong, it's wrong, right?But many

141
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:53,200
times goes beyond that.We ask because we want something that we believe has to be

142
00:16:53,200 --> 00:17:00,320
So.We ask for pride, we ask for envy, or many times we ask because we want that

143
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:09,720
It's right.And capable spend a lot of time and we spend many situations and we don't see an answer.And the

144
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:15,440
Santiago's book tells us that, Lord Belé is the intention of our heart.If we are

145
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,400
asking for something because we have a personal well -being, we want because that will help us

146
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:27,880
We feel good and capable is a bit selfish on our part.Or capable we ask because this

147
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:34,359
It will not allow feelings better and believe that we can achieve things that other people cannot reach.

148
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:46,000
But many times God sees the intention.The secret many times the answer of what God

149
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:56,079
It is because it sees the intention of our heart.Why do we ask?What do we ask for?TRUE?So that

150
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:04,799
We ask?And therefore we what do we aspire when we ask the Lord something?

151
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:10,920
We aspire to our personal benefit.What's not bad, right?Because it would be good.Because one

152
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:17,000
You want to feel good, capable of you aspire to have a house, aspire to have a vehicle, aspire to have

153
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,559
Good profession, aspire to have a good family, aspire to have a good relationship with their parents,

154
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:30,440
With their children and that is good, but that is his things.But capable of Jamal side, something that

155
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:37,119
It is very important that it has to do with those aspirations in which God wants to do something

156
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:47,920
In our life.Many times God sees without us ask for things to see the

157
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:53,799
God's blessing in our life.Because God wants to bless our life.Not for the

158
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,839
Things that we want important, but for the things that God wants to do with us.

159
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:04,960
And that through that we can share our families, we can share our

160
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,079
loved ones, we can share the people we call, we can share with our partners

161
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:17,799
of work, we can share with our neighbors.The Lord see that right?Go, practically

162
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:29,519
What is my aspiration?Personal look, my greed, my codice, my pride, I aspire because I want

163
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:35,920
May God do that complete work in my life.They know, today we are living special times,

164
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:41,400
TRUE?We are in a time of grace and here we are privileged because we have the freedom of

165
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,200
To be able to share the word of the Lord and be able to have freedom, we are.And we are seeing that in

166
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:52,039
Some places are not like that, in some places they cannot share the Word of God.It has to

167
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:59,359
Being hidden, I shared with Mary that some places are prohibited to be a Christian,

168
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:05,359
You can't pray, or if you see it out, we still have certain freedoms yet.

169
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:10,960
And all that has to do with what I did the Word of God, right?The things that will happen in

170
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,000
The last time, these eschatological situations that we can manipulate, but we are seeing,

171
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,319
Natural disasters, wars, all these situations right?A technology that reaches

172
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:31,440
Maximum, as to go, we saw yesterday showed me a small video in which I think a singer

173
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:39,359
He spoke with the AI Right?And I asked him if he existed, what happened after death,

174
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:45,519
What happened to the resurrection?And the AI answers, well, there a, but recognize

175
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,519
of Jesus, who was the Son of God, and there he spoke of some situations that if the antichrist was,

176
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:55,319
He wasn't, and said that if he had arrived, because we beat, right?It was the antichrist,

177
00:20:55,319 --> 00:21:01,720
A computer will be AI, it will be people, that's it, and all those things that can

178
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:08,119
Press in our life.And we live like this, in which we are accessing a lot of information,

179
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:13,759
What did not have it before?I remember when I was a boy if you did not have a newspaper or not

180
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:18,799
I would see the TV and capable had nothing else, I couldn't enter a computer and be able to do

181
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,279
Everything we do, and we are contemporaries, all nor the merdo?TRUE?TRUE?Did you have or that?

182
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:30,279
There was no more, today is another time that can acquire anything and can have that freedom.

183
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:38,480
But notice how interesting, right?Know that God wants to bless our life and know

184
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,240
that we are also part of the people of God, and as part of the people of God God also have

185
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,720
A purpose with us, and God also wants to do something in our life, God wants

186
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:55,960
That we do something too, something in our life.Last Sunday we talked a little about this,

187
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:02,880
truth, that the Lord is like that potter who is molding and that many times we pass

188
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,559
Things, we live, we have experience, we live a lot of situations, but that does not do

189
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:14,720
Ébalidos that this training process will always be, although we have experience,

190
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,640
Although it is more capo in the things we do, because God always perfects us.

191
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,039
The apostle Paul does not say that we can reach the fullness of Christ, right?

192
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:30,480
And then the Lord, how that good potter is not going to perfect.Now the Lord sees the intention.

193
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:40,119
I want to approach, right?To the Lord, or I ask the Lord something, and many times we

194
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:46,519
We ask the Lord something, why are we whims?Why do we want something?And that a

195
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:53,480
Lord goes, for his love and for his mercy, but there is a point where the situation remains

196
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:59,839
As in this puffy, right?Lord, nothing moves, and we are there asking, crying out,

197
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:06,839
asking, crying out, and Lord, does nothing, because he is seeing our intention.The Lord

198
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:17,559
What he had to do at that moment with Bartimae was done, he heard it, he saw it, called it,

199
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:24,599
He had a relationship with him and not just that, he said, what do you want me to do for you?

200
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,920
You need his need, but there was an obvious need, right?But he is not seeing that I continue,

201
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:38,440
The same as the Lord asked him, because he always sees, as I said, beyond, there is an intention

202
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:46,720
With that question, to see, who really?And there would have happened many things,

203
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,039
Able Bartimaeus, will go up, and not jado, he says, ah, this is not a prophet!How are you not realizing

204
00:23:51,039 --> 00:24:00,759
that I am blind and will go up, or that another has passed, I would have said, no, I, the truth, I want

205
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:07,839
That you give me a house, I want me to give me money, capable, it will have said, this is humiliated, that capable,

206
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:17,160
Well, you can do anything, but there was an intention and God many times in our life, you see intention.

207
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:25,519
He wants to fulfill a purpose with us, he sees our heart, he wants our life

208
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:32,359
be it changes and that we can grow too.And he wants to bless us, he wants to bless us

209
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:38,279
Really, but Mr. V, the intentions of the heart, as the book of Vios says, we will say,

210
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:45,119
Ah, Hebrews, chapter 4, verse 12, we have often heard it, because the word

211
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:51,519
of God is alive and effective and cutter than all the edges, and penetrates until it leaves

212
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:57,759
of the soul and the spirit, the coyontures and the marrows, since the phrase is key and

213
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:04,599
discerns the thoughts and intentions of the heart, the Word of God, which is the presentation

214
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:14,440
of God himself, discerns the thoughts, God discerns our thoughts and he sees more

215
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:20,240
Even, not only our mind, but the deepest, because what comes out of your mouth is

216
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,480
The one in his heart and the Lord says, discerns the intentions of the heart.

217
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:35,400
How wonderful God God, right?And he sees, and many times things are left like this because

218
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:44,799
God is waiting for something else from us, why are we asking?What

219
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:54,240
Are you looking for?TRUE?You are looking for me, you want, I do that complete work with you,

220
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,839
Or you are only looking for your needs, I always go to our needs.

221
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:07,400
They know when a child is growing, it goes through several stages, there is a stage that has to do with

222
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,960
what is smaller or early childhood, which the child obviously learning, but

223
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,759
There comes a time between the two bathrooms that has to identify certain things.The baby first

224
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:23,240
The six months tells Guu, Joa, Ja, and then it is easier to say the pa than the ma, then

225
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,759
For there he says more dad, despite how Mom says, but after the year, year and a half he has

226
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:32,519
What to say it behind, if a child to the two bathrooms, I tell me dad and mom, dad and not

227
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:37,440
Something else is happening, because it has to have a little more language, it has to

228
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,559
Understand at least 30 words and say short phrases.So if that child is three years old

229
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:49,400
Says dad and mom, dad and mom, dad and mom, and says nothing else, there is a problem.So

230
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:56,400
Many times the child is being taught and the child capable does so, and we know that it is a

231
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,220
chair, but time has passed and has to say chair, but we who do and

232
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:06,700
We give the chair.Then the boy gets used not to say chair, because I'm going to say chair if I

233
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:14,380
And he points to me, but if a moment appears and that child tells me I don't give it to me and I tell him

234
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:19,579
What do you want, what's the name of that, and he will insist and insist that he will go to a moment as not

235
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:28,460
We give him, he is going to say chair.Ah, you're the chair, yes, then I come and give it to him.Many

236
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:37,859
I am in such a deal with us.We passed throughout life, we

237
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:44,099
We get used, truth, I will always be there, he will bless us, but a point comes in our

238
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:51,099
Life that we have to define something and that we have to do.I can't say no, we have

239
00:27:51,099 --> 00:28:01,339
what to say and many times they go years and years we are, we have to talk, we have to decide,

240
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:09,099
We have to do what we have to do, because what corresponds to us.How interesting,

241
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:17,339
TRUE?And this is capable that is simple, not man, it is something practical, but you say like this and God

242
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:26,900
Know our life and know our heart.Let us return to Lucas's book again, verse 41.

243
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:37,740
So that context is, right?I am not going to talk much about the miracle or what I said,

244
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:46,500
No, I'm going to talk more about the question.So, the Lord tells him, what do you want me to do to you?And he

245
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:53,619
He said, sir, that he receives his eyes.He didn't have you, right?There he says, coma, that he receives his eyes,

246
00:28:53,619 --> 00:29:00,500
It was an affirmative, it was that and my need, that I receive the view.We go to 42, which usually

247
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:09,819
He said, receives, God does the miracle, your faith has saved you.So, how will a plus be

248
00:29:09,819 --> 00:29:15,660
Lord, right?Your faith has saved you.No, it is not only that it received it, but you

249
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:20,740
Faith has saved you.That is, here something happened in your life, it will no longer be Bartimaeus, it is not

250
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:24,940
Just because I look.The Lord could have said it, the ready, you are already healthy,

251
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:31,700
Ready, no!But he says, your faith has saved you.There is something else.He had an encounter with the teacher.

252
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:38,420
He saw the intention of his heart.He believed and knew that he could be a miracle because it wasn't a

253
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:45,740
Prophet more, but was the Son of God.And that's why he arranged and said it, right?He doesn't

254
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:52,460
He had, he did not say, well, if you are the Messiah, then, to do something, or I heard that this is the prophet,

255
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:58,779
No, he doesn't doubt.We will hear a little to the contextualization that I told him at the beginning.

256
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:07,079
Stroke and say, and I hate myself and made me approach.I jump like a spring, there flew the layer that

257
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:12,500
He had given the disciple of Juan, guided by the voices, ran his encounter.In the last act

258
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:17,779
I would still.And then, this unusual question, the same one we hear.What do you want me to do for

259
00:30:17,779 --> 00:30:31,099
you?And here this particular departure, right?He says, for a moment, I hesitated.¿Acaso, si es el mesías,

260
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:38,819
You shouldn't know my need?Isn't it evident that I am blind?And what what else

261
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:45,579
It is seeing, why do you have to ask me what is obvious?But I did not hesitate the answer.Teacher

262
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:55,099
I see, I said.Remarking it obvious.You already know the result, because now I see.But I came back

263
00:30:55,099 --> 00:31:01,140
Again and again the unusual question and I realized that all the secret was locked in it

264
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:09,859
of human freedom.Jesus did not think about me, he made me express my own desire, my own

265
00:31:09,859 --> 00:31:15,619
I wish in him.It made me do what I always wanted to do.When the others had sent me to

266
00:31:15,619 --> 00:31:21,779
Cachar, he made me talk.When the others had me to the side, he put me in the center,

267
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:28,900
making me, making me say my own feeling.When the other despised me, they did not take the

268
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:36,019
I count on my appreciation and wanted to listen to me.When for others it was simply one more to side

269
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:42,140
From the road to him I was the human being who could say what his own dignity means.

270
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:50,099
He didn't think about me, I don't speak for me, he didn't decide for me.It gave me room for my own desire,

271
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:59,859
My own voice, my own decision.The blind from the side of the road thinks, speaks, decides what

272
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:06,980
He wants in front of David's son.I was the authority, he put at my service.What do you want me to do for

273
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:17,099
you?And I fulfilled me, with my request, but he did not do it without me, he did it with my faith.Saved me,

274
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:26,140
He saved me from dignity, from my own, of mockery, of poverty that disqualifies the heartbreak that

275
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:34,779
excludes.That silly question, so he says, the author was the deepest of all.The one that

276
00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:42,740
He truly showed why the messiah is truly.Because before taking his eyes, I had

277
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:50,380
Returned the word, I had returned my dignity, I had become human again.How interesting,

278
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:55,740
Truth, here the author talks about the pain situation, as a human being, which had

279
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:02,539
past.But many times throughout our life, we are like this, right?And we are

280
00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:09,900
Hoping that lady do something in our life.And we have that encounter, which appears a

281
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:16,579
our lord.And he tells us, what do you want me to do for you?And the question would be

282
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:24,339
What would we say, right?And that obvious things go, that you go out you have a disease and you are

283
00:33:24,339 --> 00:33:30,660
Taking medication, and you are taking many things, or you are doing studies, and you see that

284
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:36,180
There is not an answer, and what happens?It is a necessity.Or capable has to do with a personal situation

285
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:44,460
In your life, in your heart, something that you cannot handle, capable of your character, your way of being,

286
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:55,180
able to invent in your heart, capable of something that you cannot leave something you see, something that

287
00:33:55,180 --> 00:34:01,859
You take, something that you make you improper, and you have tried in a lot of way.

288
00:34:01,859 --> 00:34:11,300
And you have to deal with that every day, try and cannot leave.I remember that when we were

289
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:19,780
We, when I was, God was working in my life, right?And I was like

290
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:25,380
compas a whole church that was called in your Cumán, municipal neighborhood, and there was a person who

291
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:32,340
He wanted to do things well from the previous one, he wanted to serve the Lord, but he had a problem,

292
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:41,699
The problem was him, he is Ibarrillo, he smoked, and he knew of God, he read the word,

293
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:51,059
He tried, and I remember this process, we talked, I speak a lot of time with him,

294
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:57,000
He said, well yes, yes, I'm fine, and when I saw it, I saw it, he does, the

295
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:05,320
smell feels, so, so, so.

296
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:11,800
The atmosphere was a bit complicated, because everything really was, and it was a fight that he

297
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:19,239
I had, and I remember this word many times, because we talked to him a little about this,

298
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:32,199
that God can make us free, of any situation, but the least is the Trival, now I do

299
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:40,280
That, the Lord does that for what purpose, so that the elora of God is revealed,

300
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:47,159
so that God wants to sell your life, or for you to tell you, well, I did it, I did it,

301
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,360
I do not have to be careful, I often share three things that destroy the human being,

302
00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:02,079
And even more to the people who serve the Lord too, it is power, sex and money,

303
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:10,920
They are things that destroy, what would be able to have a church, a church, a thousand, very filled,

304
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:17,599
impressive, if my heart there is vanity, if my heart just want you to be talking about me

305
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:25,079
And I go out, and he is a person who has control of all things, and I think it's fine, I don't

306
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:29,480
It would help, because the vibula says that we will have to appear before God,

307
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:36,679
And each one will appear before the Lord, both just and unfair,

308
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:44,119
The Lord is seen that we can fulfill his purpose, to be able to do his perfect will,

309
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:48,840
But it also has to do with the intention in our hearts,

310
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:55,639
We saw some aspects, because this is very long, but some aspects to realize,

311
00:36:55,639 --> 00:37:01,639
Many times that sir is not being called, and what happened this morning is telling us what

312
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:10,239
You want me to do for you, and the question is what are we going to do?

313
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:18,320
It is if we have really understood, right?We might think like bartimaeus, well,

314
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:24,760
I have this problem with this situation, right?Play problem, money problem,

315
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:31,280
Alcohol problem, sex problem, problem with my mind, what is me?It is obvious capable,

316
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:39,880
But Lord asks us what do you want me to do for you?Because he sees our hearts,

317
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:50,239
He sees the deepest, and he wants to bless our life, and that we, if we are blessing to

318
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:57,599
other people, and that we can also convey what God has done our lives to

319
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:03,320
Share or with those people who do not know, or for those people who knew and departed,

320
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:09,360
Or for those who believe they have the absolute truth of things and do not know God,

321
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:19,280
And God is calling us, how good we can be able to stop a little, right?

322
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:28,760
And able to rethink many things, say, the Lord that you want you to do, right?

323
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:36,800
Because many times we condition God to our plans, I remember committing that

324
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,800
He left with the Lord, and it's an example, right?She said, like that, I want you to do this,

325
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,119
I want you to do the other, I want you to transform, I want you to, and many times we are

326
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,800
Thus, I am Lord, I want you to do this, to transform, to do this, but many times the

327
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:58,480
Question would be, Lord, what do you want us to do?Or there is something in me that you need

328
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:07,760
Be changed, help me, because sometimes we are denied, right?I also put on, right?

329
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:13,400
Because sometimes we want we have no problem, and we have many problems.

330
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:20,760
When there is a situation with people, when there is a different treatment, when there is a circusance

331
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:26,280
Different, when it clashes with unique, another, when there are complications at home, is it more?

332
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:32,199
Whether it costs more?We can't say, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's not all right, does it cost more?

333
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:42,039
And that is where we must deepen, say sir, help me, right?And there we

334
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:49,179
Seeing ourselves and seeing our hearts, how is it?And this we saw talking

335
00:39:49,179 --> 00:40:00,199
Little of that, some Sundays behind, right?Regarding that we have to discern when there is a

336
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:05,079
Spirit of rebellion, a spirit practically in which I do what I want as me, it seems

337
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:10,400
that is that self -sufficiency, that it is not pending anything, and anyone who does not come

338
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:19,320
of God, and that God is love, and the love of God is that he smells of ours, our life is the one who

339
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:24,760
It transforms into our heart, and the love of God is what allows us to see things that others, others

340
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:30,880
We do not see, we cannot love humanly, because God is love.If you pomecí, sir,

341
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:39,000
Help us through your love to be able to achieve that love, but humanly as humans we cannot,

342
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Through the love of God, we can, because God is love.So brother or friends who don't

343
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:57,360
Come in Interneces and the Lord finds us today this morning and he would tell us this,

344
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:06,000
What do you want me to do, what do you want me to do for you, let us give it.
